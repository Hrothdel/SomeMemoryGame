# Some memory game
A simple memory game, the objective of which is to find all the pairs of matching cards as efficiently as possible. (you surely have already tried something similar, so I don't think there's any need for a long-winded explanation of the rules)

This is quite a small project that I've been assigned as a part of an online course on web development. As such, my main goal was to learn as much as possible, without needlessly overcomplicating things, so it might be a little bare-bones.
